# The unit circle of yaw on the XZ-plane has 0° at (0, 1), 90° at (-1, 0), 180° at (0, -1) and 270° at (1, 0).
#
# Yaw is not clamped to between 0° and 360°; any number is valid, including negative numbers and numbers greater than 360°.
#
# Pitch 0 is looking straight ahead, -90° is looking straight up, and 90° is looking straight down.
#
# There are an infinite number of "down"/"up" looks with different yaw; use e.g. `NORTH.down`.
