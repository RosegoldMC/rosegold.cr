puts "=== Demonstration Complete ==="
puts "Key features demonstrated:"
puts "- ✅ Proxy server creation and configuration"
puts "- ✅ TCP socket listening and connection acceptance"
puts "- ✅ Lock-out functionality for connection control"
puts "- ✅ Connection management and counting"
puts "- ✅ Basic client connection handling"
puts "- ✅ Graceful shutdown"

puts "The proxy is ready for Minecraft client connections!"
puts "Next steps would be to implement full packet forwarding"
puts "and custom command interception as described in the issue."
